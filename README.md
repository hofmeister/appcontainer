appcontainer
============

Proof of concept of a app container framework.

Anything under the root folder "apps" is entirely self contained and has nothing to do with the framework itself.

The "framework" itself consists of 2 files:

/js/apps.js and /apps.php

apps.php contains a set of functions for converting normal CommenJS modules into something that can be used in the browser.
